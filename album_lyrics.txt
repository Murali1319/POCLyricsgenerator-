1,The club isn’t the best place to find a lover So the bar is where I go Me and my friends at the table doing shots Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm) You come over and start up a conversation with just me And trust me I’ll give it a chance now Take my hand stop Put Van The Man on the jukebox And then we start to dance And now I’m singing like Girl you know I want your love Your love was handmade for somebody like me Come on now follow my lead I may be crazy don’t mind me Say boy let’s not talk too much Grab on my waist and put that body on me Come on now follow my lead Come come on now follow my lead (mmmm)
2,I’ve been reading books of old The legends and the myths Achilles and his gold Hercules and his gifts Spiderman’s control And Batman with his fists And clearly I don’t see myself upon that list But she said where’d you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I’m not looking for somebody With some superhuman gifts Some superhero Some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to Somebody I can kiss
3,Been sittin' eyes wide open behind these four walls hopin' you'll call It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hopin' at all Baby baby I feel crazy Up all night all night and every day Give me somethin' oh but you say nothin' What is happenin' to me? I don't wanna live forever 'Cause I know I'll be livin' in vain And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep callin' your name Until you come back home I just wanna keep callin' your name Until you come back home I just wanna keep callin' your name Until you come back home
4,I feel in the beginning when we're living We were tripping we were so high When you tell me that you love me were you bluffin? Was it nothing? Now you're so dry You can tell me that you're sorry But I know that you dont mean it baby dont lie Don't lie baby don't lie And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you And I can't blame you leaving 'Cause what's meant to be will always be true There isn't enough love in the atmosphere To keep you here ah There isn't enough love in the atmosphere Don't leave me hereAll alone I ride for my baby I died for my baby I'd die for my baby no lie There isn't enough love in the atmosphere In the atmosphere
5,I was wrong and you were right If I was yours and you were mine But it was all good (yeah) You were gone and I was back And I was good and you were bad But it was all good 'Cause I'm an addict I'm your patient Your lips are the medication Come here baby yeah you know just what I want You got that
6,I was walking down the street the other day Tryna distract myself But then I see your face Oh wait that's someone else Oh oh tryna play it coy Tryna make it disappear But just like the battle of Troy There's nothing subtle here oh oh In my room there's a king size space Bigger than it used to be If you want you can rent that place Call me an amenity oh oh Even if it's in my dreams oh
7,I don't need no frauds I don't need no drama when you call I don't need no fake Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes yeah 'Cause I don't need no fraud I don't need no drama when you call I don't need no lies Pick a side pick a side
8,If I lost it all today would you stay? Could my love be enough to stimulate? If shit hit the fan grenades got thrown Would you still show oh? Could you go down with me to the mat? Could we get back up and eventually laugh? Roll eyes at highs cheers in the lows and stay in the flow woah 'Cause I I only got this life And I ain't got the tim no Not to get it right oh
9,En el cómputo global de las cosas sí debemos hacer un recuento No me dejas ser infeliz a pesar de mis intentos Eres como un querubín que vuela y vuela y vuela Cantando canciones de amor cerca de mí aunque me duela Es el sol detrás de tu risa Que me ciega y me deslumbra Y tu piel que roza la mia Pero aún no se acostumbra Es la luz detrás de tus ojos Que ilumina mi penumbra
10,Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared
